If the item is not available or the payment is insufficient, the program should provide appropriate feedback.\n\n**Input:**\n- The first line contains an integer `n` (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10), the number of items in the vending machine.\n- The next `n` lines each contain three space-separated values: the name of the item (a string of up to 20 characters), the price of the item (a float with up to 2 decimal places), and the quantity of the item (an integer).\n- The following lines represent user interactions with the vending machine. Each line contains either:\n  - A single integer `k` (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n), representing the user's choice of item.\n  - The string \"q\", indicating the user wants to quit.\n- If the user selects an item, the next line contains a float representing the payment made by the user.\n\n**Output:**\n- For each user interaction, print the appropriate message based on the user's action:\n  - If the user selects an item that is out of stock, print \"Sorry, [item name] is out of stock.\"\n  - If the user provides insufficient funds, print \"Insufficient funds.\"\n  - If the user provides more than the required amount, print \"\u8fd9\u91cc\u662f\u4f60\u7684\u627e\u96f6: $[change]\".\n  - If the user provides the exact amount, print \"Thank you for your purchase.
